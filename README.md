This website was designed for my practice. I utilize JavaScript and the popular ReactJS framework to develop this website, with Tailwind CSS for design, which is excellent.

On this website, I use react-router, hooks, and other tools. This website is all about quizzes. My aim was to provide functionality that would allow users to practice and improve their coding skills.

In order to complete this project, I must use reactjs, react router, hooks, and custom links.
